# Work Day Scheduler 

This is a source code for a Work Day Scheduler.

<br>

## What is the purpose?
---
To create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of day.

This app is designed to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

**Moment.js** was also used to display the date and time element.
